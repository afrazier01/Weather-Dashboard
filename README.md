# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The challenge for this assignment was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS that is powered by JavaScript.

In this project, I learned how to practice and implement:
- Fetch API: to make information request across the network.
- Server-side APIs: Accessed OpenWeatherMap API and retrieved weather data.

## Usage

Click [Here](https://afrazier01.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/) to go to my deployed webpage. Insert a city you would like to see weather data for, then click search. The webpage will then display the city's current weather data and 5 day forecast information. You can make multiple searches and each time there will be a button generated that tracks your previous search results; to view data from a previous city, simply click on the button and the data will be rendered again. You can clear your search history and the weather data with the 'Clear History' button.

Once the webpage is open, view messages in the console and local storage data by right-clicking and selecting inspect; or for windows - Control + Shift + I and for MacOS - Command + Option + I. To see local storage, navigate to the the application tab and local storage to observe save values. To see the logged messages and data returned from the OpenWeatherMap API, navigate to the console tab.
